              local club, River Plate were interested in signing Messi but
              didn’t want to pay for his medical treatment. However, Messi was
              given a trial with Barcelona, and coach Carles Rexach was
              impressed – offering Messi a contract (written on a paper napkin!)
              which included paying for Messi’s treatment in Spain. Messi moved
              to Barcelona with his father and became part of the prestigious FC
              Barcelona youth academy.Lionel Messi is an Argentinian footballer
              widely regarded as one of the greatest players of the modern
              generation. He plays for FC Barcelona and the Argentina national
              team. He has won FIFA world player of the year four times (a
              record already).

              February 1985. His second name ‘Ronaldo’ was named after his
              father’s favourite American actor – Ronald Reagan. From an early
              age, he loved playing football. His talent, enthusiasm and love
              for the game soon became apparent. By the age of ten, his talent
              was becoming well known in Portugal and he was signed for
              Nacional, a Portuguese side from Madeira. He later signed for
              Sporting Lisbon – one of the biggest clubs in Portugal. Cristiano
              Ronaldo is a Portuguese professional footballer who has played for
              Manchester United, Real Madrid, Juventus and Portugal. Along with
              Lionel Messi, he is regularly considered to be one of the top two
              players in the world. He became the world’s most expensive player
              when Real Madrid signed him for 94 million Euros in 2009 from
              Manchester United. His sustained performance has enabled him to
              break numerous records for goal scoring and has been named FIFA
              player of the year (Ballon d’Or) five times. He has become an
              iconic figure in the sport, with an impressive record of 1,000
              professional appearances and over 700 goals.

            <h3>Marco Reus</h3>
            <p>
              Marco Reus (born 31 May 1989) is a German professional footballer,
              who plays as an attacking midfielder, winger or striker for
              Borussia Dortmund and Germany. Reus is known for his versatility,
              speed and technique. Reus spent his youth career at Borussia
              Dortmund , prior to leaving for Rot Weiss Ahlen. He has played for
              three clubs in his senior career, most notably—and with the most
              influence—in Borussia Mönchengladbach of the Bundesliga. Reus
              plays primarily as a left attacker for BVB; however, he is capable
              of playing on the right also and through the middle, due to his
              ability to closely control the ball with both feet. 2012 was his
              most successful season when, scoring 18 and assisting eight, he
              helped Borussia Mönchengladbach secure a place in the following
              season's UEFA Champions League. Reus agreed a move to his home
              club Borussia Dortmund at the end of that season. Reus wears the
              number 11 shirt for Dortmund. With Dortmund, Reus won the 2013
              DFL-Supercup. Reus was the Footballer of the Year in Germany in
              2012 and was on the UEFA Team of the Year in 2013.
